xjt is a file plug-in to load and save GIMP RGB and GRAY Images with
all its layers, channels, parasites and guides.

(see README_xjt_fileformat.txt for more Information about XJT)


   The XJT Load/Save Plugin requires:

     - GIMP 1.1.5 (or better)
     - libjpeg
     - Unix tar
     - Unix gzip   (optional)
     - Unix bzip2  (optional)

Installation:
-------------
   
   The XJT Plugin is Part of GIMP (since 1.1.x development release)
   and should be built and installed by the gimp installation.
       
Change Log: (see also revision history in the source files)
-----------
 (XJT 1.1.15,   2000.01.23)
                  - impementation of parasites
	          - string prpoerties now can contain \" and \n characters.
		    Images saved with the new XJT 1.1.15 Plugin
		    cannot be loaded by the older XJT 1.1 Plugin
		    if those characters are used in layer or channel names.
		  - The gimp internal representation of Guide orientation has changed
		    since the first xjt release (more than one time).
		    XJT  1.1.15 defines XJT_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL 0
		    for orientation values in the xjt guide property.
		    and is now independent from the gimp internal representation.
		    (Gimp's ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL is translated to XJT_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL
		    
		    Expect Guide orientation swap problems if
		    you load xjt 1.1 if they were saved with
		    older gimp 1.1.x development version prior to gimp 1.1.15

 (XJT 1.1,      1998.10.31 - 1999.03.16)
       
 1.02  1999.02.??  added load/save for resolution, tattoos, and parasites 
                   (works only with gimp 1.1.1)
 1.01  1998.11.24  added load/save for guides (works only with gimp 1.1)
                   added Makefiles to compile xjt under gimp 1.0.2 and 1.1
