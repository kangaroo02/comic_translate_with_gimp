The MapObject plug-in "todo"-list:
=================================

* Interactive positioning of directional light
* Rotation by mouse (doesn't work correctly yet and is disabled).
* Faster mapping code
* Multiple light-sources
* More objects?
* Presets (including save/load)
* Gray-scale/channels support
* Documentation
* Autoconf/automake stuff?

If there's anything you would like to add, feel free
to send me any suggestions for new stuff or improvements.

Tom
